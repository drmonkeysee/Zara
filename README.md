A [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org) interpreter written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). The current plan is to implement the [R7RS-small](https://small.r7rs.org) standard which describes a minimal, academic-oriented variant as opposed to the more expansive and practical R5RS and R6RS standards.

The focus of this project is to explore the Rust programming language and piece together a Scheme interpreter from the ground-up, so the usage of 3rd-party crates will be minimal.
